# Compressive Strength Of Concrete

---

In this project, we will dive into the cement manufacturing industry and work on predicting the compressive strength of concrete. We will explore the dataset thoroughly, use over 18 different machine learning algorithms, and perform visualization, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to find the best-performing model.

We will begin by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset. Then we will carry out data preprocessing to prepare it for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Our EDA will include univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. We will also plot pairplots to explore relationships between attributes, and use a heatmap to confirm correlations among features.

Next, we will detect outliers using box plots, and either remove or replace them with the median values for each column. We will compare the before-and-after box plots to see the impact of outlier treatment.

After that, we will proceed to feature engineering and model building. As mentioned, we will build more than 18 models, starting with Random Forest and then moving through a range of algorithms. We will use **k-fold cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning** to maximize model performance. As we build each model, we will store its accuracy score and compare results at the end to determine which model performs the best.

Throughout the process, we will experiment with hyperparameters such as maximum tree depth for decision tree models, comparing results across all algorithms. Finally, we will choose the most accurate model based on our analysis.

This is an exciting project that covers a wide range of regression techniques and model evaluation strategies.
